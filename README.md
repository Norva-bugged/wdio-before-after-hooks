# WebdriverIO Hook Test

This setup tests a setup hook in WebdriverIO with Cucumber that might run more often than expected or not work with steps as intended. Our findings show the hook triggers just once, and steps run successfully with a simple Given, When, Then structure.

## Setup
- Run `npm install`.
- Test with `npm run wdio`.
